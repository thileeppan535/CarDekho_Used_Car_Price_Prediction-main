Problem Statement:
The used car market in India is highly dynamic, with prices varying significantly based on several factors such as car make, model, mileage, condition, and current market trends. This fluctuation makes it challenging for sellers to determine an accurate price for their used cars.

Approach:
To address this challenge, I aim to develop a machine learning model that predicts the price of a used car based on key features. The model will be trained on a dataset of cars sold through CarDekho in India. Once the model is built, it can accurately estimate the price for any used car, based on its characteristics.

Objective:
The main goal is to design a robust machine learning model capable of predicting used car prices accurately.

Benefits:
This solution will offer several advantages:

Sellers can set more accurate prices for their cars, leading to quicker sales and potentially higher returns.
Buyers can find more competitively priced cars, enhancing their purchasing experience.
The overall used car market in India will become more efficient, benefiting both buyers and sellers.
This project holds the potential to positively influence the used car market in India by providing a data-driven pricing solution, and I'm enthusiastic about the improvements it can bring to the industry.
